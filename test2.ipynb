            "This commercial insurance policy primarily protects businesses against property damage, equipment breakdown, business interruption, legal liabilities, and employee-related risks. It's designed for commercial entities seeking comprehensive coverage, including terrorism and legal expenses. Notable strengths include 24/7 claims support, access to legal helplines, data breach coverage, and automatic sum reinstatement post-claim. Critical warnings: Excludes deliberate acts, fraud, asbestos-related liabilities (without strict compliance), and claims arising from unsecured properties. Coverage for terrorism is capped (£5M/event) and contingent on proof of non-state involvement. Policyholders must promptly report changes in risk exposure or occupancy to avoid invalidating coverage.\n",

            "Liberty General's Commercial Package Policy primarily protects business assets (buildings, machinery, stock) against fire, natural disasters, theft, and operational risks. Designed for Indian businesses with per-location asset values between ₹5–50 crore, it combines mandatory property coverage (Section I) with 16 optional add-ons like business interruption, burglary, equipment breakdown, and directors’ liability. Key strengths include customizable coverage, automatic sum-insured reinstatement post-claim (with premium adjustment), and built-in protections for money, temporary stock removal, and compliance costs. Critical warnings: A 5% excess per claim (min. ₹10,000), reduced payouts if underinsured below 85% asset value, terrorism exclusions, and strict claim-reporting deadlines. Non-disclosure of material facts voids coverage.\n"
